            <p>Most music has at least three main elements - melody, rhythm and harmony.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="w3-theme-l4">
            <p>Music can be a social activity, but it can also be a very spiritual experience.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="w3-theme-l4">
            <p>Ancient Indians were deeply impressed by the spiritual power of music, and it is out of this that Indian
                classical music was born. So, for those who take it seriously, classical music involves single-minded
                devotion and lifelong commitment. But the thing about music is that you can take it as seriously or as
                casually as you like. It is a rewarding experience, no matter how deep or shallow your involvement.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="w3-theme-l4">
            <p>Because of its contemplative, spiritual nature, Hindustani (north Indian) classical music is a solitary
                pursuit that focuses mainly on melodic development.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="w3-theme-l4">
            <p>In performance, rhythm also plays an important role, giving texture, sensuality, and a sense of purpose
                to melody. </p>
        </li>
        <li class="w3-theme-l4">
            <p>Harmony in Indian classical music is mainly the result of the tƒÅnpura playing a combination of the tonic
                (sa) and the fifth (pa) (or fourth (ma)) in a fixed pattern in the background, somewhat like an
                arpeggiated chord. Sympathetic strings and strumming patterns in string instruments also play a similar
                role. Harmony in the Western sense, however, is not a part of traditional Indian music, and it is
                important not to look for it. Have a look at some youtube videos teaching basics of Indian Classical
                Music.</p>
